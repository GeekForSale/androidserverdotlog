2011-02-27 17:52:44 [INFO] <Evilmurries> Oh I have no clue
2011-02-27 17:52:52 [INFO] <Evilmurries> if it would or wouldnt
2011-02-27 17:53:25 [INFO] <GeekForSale> well we have a automatic backup that runs daily, and can be inited manually also... so I guess
2011-02-27 17:53:30 [INFO] <GeekForSale> there would be no harm trying it
2011-02-27 17:54:21 [INFO] <GeekForSale> I would just have to take the server offline fora few minutes
2011-02-27 17:54:27 [INFO] <Evilmurries> If the server did get wiped I wouldnt be upset. I could always make new sand houses
2011-02-27 17:56:10 [INFO] <GeekForSale> We have a pretty intrecate backup system.. you will be fine :)
2011-02-27 17:56:30 [INFO] <GeekForSale> we can restore this thing to daily intervals to when the server was first built.
2011-02-27 17:57:10 [INFO] <Evilmurries> It's all good then
2011-02-27 17:57:31 [INFO] <Evilmurries> Im not sure there is any reason to go there except fast travel and glow blocks

2011-02-27 18:00:38 [INFO] <Evilmurries> If you do it can you back it up right now. I just started this today
2011-02-27 18:01:06 [INFO] <GeekForSale> Ya I'll run a backup before I start tweeking stuff.
2011-02-27 18:01:26 [INFO] <Evilmurries> did the patch change the shadows? It seems like the colors and lighting is a little different
2011-02-27 18:02:14 [INFO] <GeekForSale> Ya, notch said he is using a new lighting systemss
2011-02-27 18:02:51 [INFO] <GeekForSale> I hope it fixed the "dark block" problem I've been seeing
2011-02-27 18:03:32 [INFO] <Evilmurries> I havent seen any bugs yet but its the first time  Ireally got to play since patch
2011-02-27 18:03:51 [INFO] <GeekForSale> Have you read the patch notes?
2011-02-27 18:04:04 [INFO] <Evilmurries> Brian linked them to me but I only checked out the new items
2011-02-27 18:04:24 [INFO] <GeekForSale> I like the fact that we can "sleep" during the night
2011-02-27 18:07:15 [INFO] <Evilmurries> I was messing with texture packs today but I can't for the life of me figure it out
2011-02-27 18:07:34 [INFO] <Evilmurries> I open the rars, and for some reason or another cannot view the ,jar files
2011-02-27 18:08:06 [INFO] <GeekForSale> the jar files should be the java code
2011-02-27 18:09:01 [INFO] <Evilmurries> Yeah I need to look at it again
2011-02-27 18:09:11 [INFO] <Evilmurries> because there are some real sweet texture packs
2011-02-27 18:09:39 [INFO] <GeekForSale> Ya... I want to use one too but I haven't really looked into them yet.
2011-02-27 18:10:10 [INFO] <Evilmurries> some are straight up gorgeous
2011-02-27 18:17:40 [INFO] <Evilmurries> I haven't found any dungeons in multiplayer so far either

2011-02-27 18:19:32 [INFO] <GeekForSale> So it looks like I'm going to have to cycle the server in order to turn hell world on
2011-02-27 18:19:48 [INFO] <Evilmurries> what does that mean
2011-02-27 18:19:55 [INFO] <GeekForSale> I'll have to restart it
2011-02-27 18:20:02 [INFO] <GeekForSale> but the maps will be saved
2011-02-27 18:20:25 [INFO] <Evilmurries> cool
2011-02-27 18:21:15 [INFO] <GeekForSale> it will take me about a minute to run the backup and enable the setting... you want to try it?

2011-04-03 22:15:42 [INFO] <Xonmalec> Not according to Communist doctrine
2011-04-03 22:15:58 [INFO] <CactusOfDoom> But to what end would you keep everything?
2011-04-03 22:16:04 [INFO] <CactusOfDoom> Should we not share and share alike?
2011-04-03 22:16:16 [INFO] <Xonmalec> With communism, we are al entitled to your work
2011-04-03 22:16:25 [INFO] <Ihazbucketz> this is true but who needs gold but just to show off? shouldnt you be able to keep what you want

2011-04-03 22:16:43 [INFO] <CactusOfDoom> But not in a hidden box
2011-04-03 22:16:54 [INFO] <Xonmalec> IT IS A SIGN OF THE CAPILATIST OPPRESSION OF THE WORKERS

2011-04-03 22:19:06 [INFO] <CactusOfDoom> Why do you need to?
2011-04-03 22:19:26 [INFO] <Ihazbucketz> because i am the mayor! i am intitled to my own labor
2011-04-03 22:19:35 [INFO] <CactusOfDoom> No one voted you the mayor!
2011-04-03 22:19:42 [INFO] <CactusOfDoom> You said you were yourself

2011-04-03 22:20:46 [INFO] <CactusOfDoom> We could be libertarians
2011-04-03 22:20:56 [INFO] <CactusOfDoom> do each as he finds, and do each as he is given
2011-04-03 22:21:02 [INFO] <CactusOfDoom> to each*
2011-04-03 22:21:09 [INFO] <Ihazbucketz> i give all the diamond i find
2011-04-03 22:21:32 [INFO] <CactusOfDoom> So? Keep your gold?
2011-04-03 22:21:40 [INFO] <CactusOfDoom> It doesn't serve the community
2011-04-03 22:21:45 [INFO] <Ihazbucketz> if you choose so. then so be it
2011-04-03 22:22:42 [INFO] <Ihazbucketz> well that was revivting
2011-04-03 22:22:53 [INFO] <CactusOfDoom> Good revolution everyone
2011-04-03 22:22:58 [INFO] <Ihazbucketz> yes
2011-04-03 22:22:59 [INFO] <FampaxMachine> Jolly good then
2011-04-03 22:23:00 [INFO] <FampaxMachine> :D
2011-04-03 22:23:02 [INFO] <Xonmalec> We must put these laws into word, a room for laws anyone?
2011-04-03 22:23:03 [INFO] <CactusOfDoom> :D
2011-04-03 22:23:12 [INFO] <CactusOfDoom> Signs of commandments? hahaha
2011-04-03 22:23:15 [INFO] <Ihazbucketz> lol
2011-04-03 22:23:21 [INFO] <Ihazbucketz> i thouhgt of it

2011-04-03 22:23:29 [INFO] <Ihazbucketz> thought*
2011-04-03 22:23:54 [INFO] <Xonmalec> It would clear up most future disputes
2011-04-03 22:24:02 [INFO] <Ihazbucketz> t
2011-04-03 22:24:13 [INFO] <CactusOfDoom> We should just share all the iron and coal and basically everything but gold
2011-04-03 22:24:16 [INFO] <Ihazbucketz> each man can keep his gold he finds or share it
2011-04-03 22:24:17 [INFO] <Xonmalec> And the need for a messy revolution, like the one we just went through, would be moot
2011-04-03 22:24:20 [INFO] <CactusOfDoom> because gold doesn't really serve the community
2011-04-03 22:24:40 [INFO] <Xonmalec> So it is written, so it shall be
2011-04-03 22:25:04 [INFO] <CactusOfDoom> Also, no more railroad tracks because it takes up too many resources
2011-04-03 22:25:13 [INFO] <FampaxMachine> Fair enough
2011-04-03 22:25:15 [INFO] <Ihazbucketz> so one law? keep your gold or share it lol
2011-04-03 22:25:17 [INFO] <Xonmalec> All in favor?
2011-04-03 22:25:28 [INFO] <CactusOfDoom> I guess we could vote on using iron for rails n shit
2011-04-03 22:25:38 [INFO] <CactusOfDoom> ya know, big stuff

2011-04-10 17:24:16 [INFO] <CactusOfDoom> Gotta use swords to kill them
2011-04-10 17:24:36 [INFO] <Xonmalec> Don't do enough damage otherwise?
2011-04-10 17:24:47 [INFO] <CactusOfDoom> If you don't use a sword then they subdivide

2011-04-10 22:03:29 [INFO] <Xonmalec> You said I could
2011-04-10 22:03:49 [INFO] <FampaxMachine> Yeah, I never knew you'd follow up with it. Cause Bards are useless.
2011-04-10 22:04:05 [INFO] <Xonmalec> Precisely why I wanna be one
2011-04-10 22:05:47 [INFO] <Xonmalec> PS: They don't look that useless
2011-04-10 22:06:02 [INFO] <FampaxMachine> They're kiiinda useless.
2011-04-10 22:06:16 [INFO] <Xonmalec> Nah, they're amazing outside of combat
2011-04-10 22:07:00 [INFO] <FampaxMachine> A little. They're Rogue-y so they've got skill points up the wazoo
2011-04-10 22:07:19 [INFO] <FampaxMachine> Unfortunately, you guys are in a dungeon of sorts, meaning combat up ahead.

2011-05-17 19:15:27 [INFO] <skippyishappy> rather than my place to your island place
2011-05-17 19:16:18 [INFO] <GeekForSale> well with that switch you have the option
2011-05-17 19:16:27 [INFO] <GeekForSale> hum i wonder
2011-05-17 19:17:17 [INFO] <GeekForSale> darn i thought it would throw the other switch
2011-05-17 19:17:17 [INFO] <skippyishappy> can you go up the hill and towards my place?
2011-05-17 19:18:02 [INFO] <GeekForSale> not with this setup
2011-05-17 19:19:06 [INFO] <skippyishappy> can this be a switch?

2011-05-17 19:21:48 [INFO] <GeekForSale> well when we start from the ohter side there is no way of knowing if the track
2011-05-17 19:21:52 [INFO] <GeekForSale> leads to your house or my house
2011-05-17 19:22:06 [INFO] <skippyishappy> it would be cool to stop the train here
2011-05-17 19:22:09 [INFO] <skippyishappy> have 2 buttons
2011-05-17 19:22:25 [INFO] <skippyishappy> press 1, and it switches the track and fires the powered rail to push you
2011-05-17 19:22:41 [INFO] <skippyishappy> press2, and it moves it to yours and fires the powered rail
2011-05-17 19:23:02 [INFO] <skippyishappy> or what about
2011-05-17 19:23:04 [INFO] <GeekForSale> I don't think we can pull levers or push buttons in a mine cart

2011-05-17 19:24:38 [INFO] <GeekForSale> we have to go back to the origial setup then ecause your train just goes onto mine
2011-05-17 19:24:54 [INFO] <GeekForSale> your track just goes to my house
2011-05-17 19:25:16 [INFO] <GeekForSale> oh ya the lever

2011-05-17 19:44:51 [INFO] <GeekForSale> but i'm never going to be able to get to grand station
2011-05-17 19:45:09 [INFO] <GeekForSale> unless switch is thrown
2011-05-17 19:45:16 [INFO] <GeekForSale> it needs to be a merge
2011-05-17 19:45:35 [INFO] <GeekForSale> becuase there is no way to tell what direction the track is pointing

2011-05-17 23:55:04 [INFO] <skippyishappy> the only issue is coming back up the first hill too much speed and it blows past the stop

2011-05-17 23:55:24 [INFO] <skippyishappy> so you can ride the full length

2011-05-17 23:57:43 [INFO] <skippyishappy> hmm yeah
2011-05-17 23:58:07 [INFO] <skippyishappy> part from the station up is pretty good
2011-05-17 23:58:30 [INFO] <skippyishappy> below the station need to manage the speed a lil... so you always make to the
2011-05-17 23:58:39 [INFO] <skippyishappy> the downhill of the station launcher
2011-05-18 00:01:16 [INFO] <skippyishappy> im on the rail back

2011-05-18 00:04:54 [INFO] <skippyishappy> the station at your island house is almost money
2011-05-18 00:05:42 [INFO] <skippyishappy> if we put on the long straights two sets of rails, we could rig it to automatically
2011-05-18 00:05:57 [INFO] <skippyishappy> route traffic going one way to one track
2011-05-18 00:06:08 [INFO] <skippyishappy> and the other the other way
2011-05-18 00:06:18 [INFO] <GeekForSale> ya... this will need to be done because of traffic
2011-05-18 00:06:21 [INFO] <skippyishappy> and then merge them back before the uphill to the station
2011-05-18 00:06:46 [INFO] <skippyishappy> that will maybe prevent some collisions in the middle of the stations
2011-05-18 00:07:00 [INFO] <skippyishappy> in between
2011-05-18 00:07:17 [INFO] <GeekForSale> chris's house is somewhere in between too... we will need to have another routeing method implimtene
2011-05-18 00:07:23 [INFO] <GeekForSale> implimented in the middle somewhere...
2011-05-18 00:09:05 [INFO] <skippyishappy> yeah the goal should be to get from any station to another without getting out of the cart

2011-05-18 00:10:20 [INFO] <skippyishappy> my secondary goal is to make it look sharp

2011-06-16 22:29:13 [INFO] <GeekForSale> to craft a glowstone you need 4 glowstone dusts... when I try to craft the item "sticks" in

2011-06-16 22:29:25 [INFO] <skippyishappy> ah
2011-06-16 22:29:55 [INFO] <GeekForSale> the workaround was to put 9 glowstone dust in to craft an imagenary block...yada yada
2011-06-16 22:30:47 [INFO] <GeekForSale> Point is...I guess notch can choose what versions servers can run with what clients.
